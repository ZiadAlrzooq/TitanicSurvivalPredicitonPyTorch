# Titanic Survival Prediction with PyTorch

This project is an implementation of the Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction competition using PyTorch, I'm aiming to predict the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset contains various features such as passenger class, age, sex, and fare, which are utilized to train a machine learning model.

# Overview
The main goal of this project is to leverage the power of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, to create and train a neural network model for predicting whether a passenger survived or not based on the provided dataset. The project explores various aspects of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development using PyTorch's capabilities.

# Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and stratified shuffling based on important features.
- **Model Development**: Building and training a neural network using PyTorch for survival prediction.
- **Evaluation and Submission**: Evaluating model performance and creating a submission CSV file for the Kaggle competition.

Please be aware that this is my first machine learning project, so there might be mistakes present. Therefore, it's advisable not to consider the predictions as highly reliable.
